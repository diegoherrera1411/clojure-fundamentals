# clojure-fundamentals

The goal of this repo is to document the practicing exercises while
learning clojure!

I'm basing my knowledge on the following references
* D. Higginbotham. **[Clojure for the brave and true](https://www.braveclojure.com/introduction/)**. Free online
* Project Euler. **[Problem Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)**. For practicing what I learn

The goal of this repo is to gather important clojure concepts, while also having fun solving problems! This will
hopefully be an enjoyable ride!

## Project structure

The source code is contained entirely in `src`. While the journal for tips and
tricks on clojure, as well as some lessons from the book, are contained in `journal`.
The source code for the learning exercise can be found in `src/main`. As I'm looking forward to level up 
my game as a developer, I'm also setting up unit tests for the functions used in the solutions of the problems, 
which can be found in `src/test`

## How to Run Source Code

I'm using IntelliJ CE as my editor. This means that I'm using the integrated REPL for running the functions in the
main directory. For running tests, I'm using Cursive plugin tools. I'm planning on setting up kaocha for testing so
that I can also run the tests on the REPL.

## Important remarks

> * A solution to a Project Euler problem is posted only when it has been approved
>   by the grading tool! Feel free to send your PR if you have a better solution!
> * Solutions to Brave & True exercises are not graded, and can possibly be improved
>   upon! Please feel free to commit your solution in a PR!
