# clojure-fundamentals

The goal of this repo is to document the practicing exercises while
learning clojure!

I'm basing my knowledge on the following references
* D. Higginbotham. **[Clojure for the brave and true](https://www.braveclojure.com/introduction/)**. Free online
* Project Euler. **[Problem Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)**. For practicing what I learn

The goal of this repo is to gather important clojure concepts, while also having fun solving problems!
